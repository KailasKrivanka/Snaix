# Snaix
A simple snake game, one of my first projects in JS (circa 2015)

Written entirely in vanilla JS it guided my learning of JavaScript and HTML. It was originally designed as a chrome app but can be run seperately in any browser. [snaix.html](/snake/snaix.html) contains the most finished version while [snake_original.html](snake/snake_original.html) contains an initial version.
