# Snaix
A simple snake game, one of my first projects in JS (circa 2015)

Written entirely in vanilla JS it guided my learning of JavaScript and HTML. It was originally designed as a chrome app but can be run seperately in any browser. snaix.html contains the most finished version while snake_original contains an initial version.
